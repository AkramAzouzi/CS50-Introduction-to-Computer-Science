Lecture 8: Information ==> Algorithmic Precision

Part 1: Computer Science is Problem Solving
- Ways to solve problems --> using numbers, letters, binary
- Algorithms are steps to solve the problem. Programming is the use of algorithms to produce a language that a computer can understand.





Part 2: Precision and Correctness
- instructions can come in different forms like abstractions, step by step, shapes
- the same applies to instructing a computer to execute a method
    - this is equivalent of verbal instructions to programming




Part 3: Information
- input --> algorithms --> output
- think about whether you should instruct the computer to do something or not
    - data is information, and with this power, responsibility comes into question
    - for example --> passwords





Part 4: pin.py --> hacking into someones account using computer programming to discover someones pin

    for i in range(0000, 100000):
        print(f"I am checking {i:04}....)"

- programmers are able to decide whether to use their coding skills for good or bad





Part 5: password.py

from time import sleep

with open("large", "r") as file:
    for word in file.readlines():
    print(f"Checking {word.rstrip}...")
    sleep(.1)




Part 6: Cookies and Developer Tools
- cookies are not a bad thing as it speeds up and provides information to personal data
- but this can also be a vulernability. Websites can use cookies to target users with advertisements and (malevolent) computer programmers






Part 7: Snapchat and SQL
- Soft delete vs hard delete
- Soft deletion can still be leaked out
- hard deletion is what we hope Snapchat uses
- which one does Snapchat use?
- the notion of "unsending" does not exist




Part 8: Final Project --> Tracks

- Web Programming --> HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and SQL --> CS50 Finance website, buying stocks using virtual dollars using a SQL database
- Mobile app development --> iOS Swift or Android Java --> Creating a pokedex, instagram using filters, note taker app
- game development --> Lua --> creating Pong
