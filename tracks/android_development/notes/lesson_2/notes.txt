Android Development - Lesson 2 Notes

Android build system --> called "Gradle"
- Is a build system that is already in the app once created

MVC --> Model View Controller
- separating out the logic of the app into three pieces
- Model: Data the app needs (i.e. "tracks" from JavaExample)
- View: How your data is going to be displayed
- Controlled: the bridge between model and View 
    - gathers the data and sends it to the View
- Activities: each screen represents one thing that you are trying to accomplish
    - one screen shows contacts
    - another screen shows a specific contacts
- Resources: all other stuff in the app that is not just Java
    - HTML, XML, CSS etc.
- Intent: represents a way to go from one activity to another
Recycler View: common class in android apps
    - represents anything like a list of items (tweets, contacts, instagram posts, etc.)
