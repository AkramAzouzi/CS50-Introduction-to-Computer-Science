Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Used in conjunction with HTML files:

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>
            Some Text
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, World!
    </body>
</html>

--------------------------------------------

Usually, to use CSS, people would embed it into the HTML files
but you also have the option to make the CSS file separate

Example of embedding into an HTML file:
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello, world</h1>
<p style="color: red;">This is a practice webpage</p>

--------------------------------------------

Two different kinds of styling:

In-style --> Where you style tags inside that tag themselves (noted above)

Header style --> All shared-tags can be styled with one line of code in the Header:
    <head>
        <title>
            Practice
        </title>
        <style>
            h2 {
                text-align: center;
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
